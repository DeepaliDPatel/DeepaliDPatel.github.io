### Projects:

## 1. Statistical classification of human voices

Tools/Algorithms: Python, R, Logistic Regression, Random Forest

   - Identify human voices based on acoustic properties of voice and speech
   - Pre-processed dataset by acoustic analysis in python and R with an analyzed frequency of 0hz-280hz
   - Used correlation plots and converted data into actionable insights by predicting measures and performing
     Logistic Regression and Random Forest
   - Used AUC score and confusion matrix to measure the performance between both algorithms and derive
     relationships between the features
## 2. [Kaggle 2020 DataScience & ML Survey data analysis and visualization](https://github.com/DeepaliDPatel/Kaggle2020-DataScience-Survey)
   
   - Performed Exploratory Data analysis on Kaggle's Data Science and ML Survey
   - Derived insights to explore and answer questions such as education/ work experience history for a Data Science role, best ways for new data sientists to break into the field, Gender vs Compensation, Experience vs Compensation and much more
  
## 3. Quality inspection in manufacturing using deep learning based computer vision

Tools/Algorithms: Dash Plotly, Python Flask, MongoDB, TensorFlow, Python

   - Developed a deep learning model to detect faulty objects in a manufacturing line for Quality purposes
   - Used Tensorflow, Keras and Python to custom build a dataset
   - Performed feature extraction and classification to identity defected items

## 4. Net hourly electrical energy output (PE) for Combined Cycle Power Plant

Tools/Algorithms: Python, R, Linear Regression, Random Forest

   - Analyze data from 6 years when the plant was set to work with full load
   - Clean, load and analyze data for research and compare performance of Linear Regression vs Random Forest
   - Analyzed correlation plots, dependency between each feature and target variable
   - Used Linear Regression and Random forest to compare the performance, resulting in 93% Testing accuracy for Linear
     Regression vs 95% testing accuracy for Random Forest
     
## 5. [Exploratory Data Analysis on Black Friday Sales data](https://github.com/DeepaliDPatel/Black-Friday-Sales-data-analysis)

   -	Perform demographic data analysis on black Friday sales dataset in Python
   -	Presented Quantitative business driven ideas for black Friday sales that could help boost the sales up by at least 21%
