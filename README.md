###Projects:

## [1. Statistical classification of human voices](https://github.com/DeepaliDPatel/Statistical-analysis-of-human-Voices)

Tools/Algorithms: Python, R, Logistic Regression, Random Forest

   - Identify human voices based on acoustic properties of voice and speech
   - Pre-processed dataset by acoustic analysis in python and R with an analyzed frequency of 0hz-280hz
   - Used correlation plots and converted data into actionable insights by predicting measures and performing
     Logistic Regression and Random Forest
   - Used AUC score and confusion matrix to measure the performance between both algorithms and derive
     relationships between the features
  
##2. Quality inspection in manufacturing using deep learning based computer vision

Tools/Algorithms: Dash Plotly, Python Flask, MongoDB, TensorFlow, Python

   - Developed a deep learning model to detect faulty objects in a manufacturing line for Quality purposes
   - Used Tensorflow, Keras and Python to custom build a dataset
   - Performed feature extraction and classification to identity defected items

##3. Net hourly electrical energy output (PE) for Combined Cycle Power Plant

Tools/Algorithms: Python, R, Linear Regression, Random Forest

   - Analyze data from 6 years when the plant was set to work with full load
   - Clean, load and analyze data for research and compare performance of Linear Regression vs Random Forest
   - Analyzed correlation plots, dependency between each feature and target variable
   - Used Linear Regression and Random forest to compare the performance, resulting in 93% Testing accuracy for Linear
     Regression vs 95% testing accuracy for Random Forest
