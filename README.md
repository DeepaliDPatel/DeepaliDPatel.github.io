Some of my Projects:

[1. Statistical classification of human voices] (https://deepalidpatel.github.io/Statistical-analysis-of-human-Voices/)
   - Identify human voices based on acoustic properties of voice and speech in Python and R
   - Pre-processed dataset by acoustic analysis in python and R with an analyzed frequency of 0hz-280hz
   - Used correlation plots and converted data into actionable insights by predicting measures and performing
     Logistic Regression and Random Forest
   - Used AUC score and confusion matrix to measure the performance between both algorithms and derive
     relationships between the features
